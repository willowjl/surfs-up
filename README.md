# Overview of the statistical analysis:
## purpose
### The purpose of this analysis was to review weather data and use it to determine how temperature would affect a prospective surf and ice cream shop. The owner of the shop is looking for an investor and supporting data analysis to backup the shop's potential given that weather in Hawaii could be a risk factor. 

# Results:
### * The two main data points used were June and December. They both had an average of 75 degrees and 71 degrees respectively. Given that the shop is located in Oahu, Hawaii, this was expected to be warm weather year around. 
### * On the low end, June's lowest point was 64 degrees while December was a bit colder and reached 56 degrees. 
### * Both June and December had similar standard deviation. June had a 3.25 std and December 3.75 std, meaning that year-round, the temperature are pretty to one another and close to the mean temperature.

# Summary:
### A more thoughrough analysis could be given by assessing other factors that could affect the shop. In addition to looking at the temperature data, we could also look at precipitation as well. If there is a tourist traffic data to filter for inbounds flights to Oahu, the owner could have a better idea where most of the sales would come from. Lastly, looking at and understanding outliers within the given data could help us understand the integrity of the current analysis. For the month of December for example, even though there is a lower temperature point, a few of the data in that quartile are outliers, the mean is somewhat similar to the month of June. This should be expected since Hawaii is a toursistic zone that is very popular for its great weather all year-round.
